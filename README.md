This page provides weather information to the user. Upon loading it makes a geolocation request to the browser and - if that is accepted - displays the weather based on that location. The search box on the left allows the user to search for the weather of a particular city, with the search then stored in an array in local storage. Previous searches are brought from local storage and displayed as buttons. Cities are not duplicated in the array, and if there is no weather information for the city entered it is not added to the array. 

The main box displays the city name, the date, the current temperature, the humidity, the windspeed, and the UV index. The UV Index is colour coded to indicate the level of danger presented by the UV light. The five boxes down the bottom contain a five day forecast with date, weather icon, temperature and humidity.
